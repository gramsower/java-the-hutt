# Java the Hutt

## Coffee Inventory Control

### By **Greg Ramsower**

This Application allows a user to track coffee bean inventory for their coffee shop, Java the Hutt.
The user can add a bulk order of beans and input the following parameters for each bean type:
  - Name
  - Price per pound (USD)
  - Initial inventory level in pounds
  - Roast level
  - Origin
  - Tasting notes

After a bean has been entered into inventory, the user can quickly decrement each bean type in one-pound increments by clicking on a 'sell a pound of beans' button below each bean type.

Optionally, the user can edit a bean type to correct information, adjust inventory level directly, or delete the bean type once all of it has sold.
